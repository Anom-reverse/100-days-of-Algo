### Matrix Search
Given a matrix of integers A of size N x M and an integer B.

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for integar B in matrix A.

This matrix A has the following properties:
Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than or equal to the last integer of the previous row.

Return 1 if B is present in A, else return 0.

### Rotated Sorted Array Search

Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

array A is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 ).

You are given a target value B to search. If found in the array, return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
